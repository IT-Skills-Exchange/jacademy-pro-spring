## Spring Framework

Welcome to the chapter on Spring Framework! Spring is a widely used Java framework for building robust applications.
In this chapter, we will explore its key features and components, empowering you to develop scalable Java applications.

Throughout this chapter, we will cover Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data, and Spring Boot. By leveraging these modules,
you will learn how to create loosely coupled components, handle web requests, interact with databases, and streamline development.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the Spring Framework, ready to build flexible Java applications.
Let's dive into the world of Spring and enhance your Java development skills!
